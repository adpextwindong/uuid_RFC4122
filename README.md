# uuid_RFC4122
Fast UUID generator, RFC4122 version 4 compliant based on [Jeff Ward's](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21963136).

It's been simply ported to ESModule for my convience.

There are some [caveats](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105034/how-to-create-a-guid-uuid/21963136#comment50951376_21963136) to it apparently.
